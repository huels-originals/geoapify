# A CLI and Python Client for Geoapify

We have been using Geoapify to **geocode millions of location records** for data validation and analytics. We built
this package to make this process comfortable using Python and the command line.

Why Geoapify and this package may also be a good fit for you:

- You need to batch process large numbers of location records (geocode, reverse geocode, places & details).
- The license must support commercial use without restrictions.
- It needs to be cheap (or even for free if you don't need more than 6k addresses per day).

Sign up at [geoapify.com](https://geoapify.com/) and start with their free plan of 3k credits per day which translates
to up to 6k address geocodings.
