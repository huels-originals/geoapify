geoapify.com REST API Python Client
===================================

You need to batch geocode millions of address records, and do you prefer to do so in Python? Then I have good news
for you. All you need to do is `sign up at geoapify.com <https://www.geoapify.com/>`_, install our *geapify* Python
package, and execute a few lines of code.

Do you need more than just geocoding? Check out the Products & Services on Geoapify and see if our client covers the
endpoint you need. If not, contribute a pull request.
