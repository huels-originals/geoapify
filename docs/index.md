# A Python Client for the Geoapify API

You need to batch (reverse) geocode/enrich with details large numbers of address records, and do you prefer to do so in
Python? Then this documentation is the right place to start with. You look for something related yet other than what
we mentioned? Check the [Geoapify's API docs](https://apidocs.geoapify.com/#docs) and if the endpoint is not covered yet
by our Python client, it will be soon (hopefully). 

Before you start, [sign up at geoapify.com](https://www.geoapify.com/) to generate your personal API key with a free
tier of 3000 credits (e.g., = 6000 address geocodings per day).
